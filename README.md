# Ghub Jupyter Book Template

This Jupyter Book tool provides a template and a guideline for you to create a Jupyter Book tool on the [Ghub Science Gateway](https://theghub.org).

Jupyter Book is an open-source tool for building publication-quality books and documents. We assume you are familiar with creating a Jupyter Book and with the structure of a Jupyter Book. See [Built with Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [Create a Template Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/create.html) for tutorials and more information on creating a Jupyter Book.   

On Ghub, the template's Makefile, showbook&#46;sh, and invoke scripts are required, to build Jupyter Books which enable the books' generated HTML files to display consistently across web browsers. This tool will guide you through the steps for creating a Jupyter Book tool on Ghub and incorporating these required files.

This tool is published on the [Ghub Science Gateway](https://theghub.org), see [Ghub Jupyter Book Template](https://theghub.org/tools/ghubex2) to launch this tool on Ghub. You must be logged in as a Ghub member to launch this tool, see [Join Ghub](https://theghub.org/about/joining) for more information.
